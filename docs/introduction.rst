.. note::
    These docs are under development. In particular, many of the modules have not
    yet been completed and some of the extensions are not documented in great
    detail. If you find any issues, confusing bits, or have suggestions to make
    them more complete or clearer, please open an issue or a PR. Thanks!

Welcome to ``moments``! ``moments`` implements methods for inferring demographic
history and patterns of selection from genetic data, based on solutions to the
diffusion approximations to the site-frequency spectrum (SFS).
The SFS implementation and interface of ``moments`` is large based on the
`∂a∂i <https://bitbucket.org/gutenkunstlab/dadi/>`_ open
source package developed by `Ryan Gutenkunst <http://gutengroup.mcb.arizona.edu>`_.
We largely reuse ``∂a∂i``'s interface but introduced a new simulation engine. This
new method is based on the direct computation of the frequency spectrum without
solving the diffusion system. Consequently we circumvent the numerical PDE
approximations and we get rid of the frequency grids used in ``∂a∂i``.

``moments.LD`` implements methods for computing linkage disequilibrium statistics
and running multi-population demographic inference using patterns of LD. This
extension contains methods for parsing phased or unphased sequencing data to
compute LD-decay for a large number of informative two-locus statistics, and
then uses those statistics to infer demographic history for large numbers of
populations.

``moments`` was developed in
`Simon Gravel's group <http://simongravel.lab.mcgill.ca/Home.html>`_ in the Human
Genetics department at McGill University, with maintenance and development by the
Gravel Lab and `Aaron Ragsdale <http://apragsdale.github.io>`_.
