Demography and genetic diversity
================================

.. todo:: This module has not been completed.

Intro - intuition about how demography is expected to affect summary statistics
helps in hypothesizing historical scenarios to explain observed patterns of genetic
diversity, or trouble-shooting poor fits of models to data. It's also important
to understand how demographic parameters can be confounded and different evolutionary
scenarios can give rise to similar patterns of genetic diversity.

*****************************
Measures of genetic diversity
*****************************

.. todo:: Many of the common single-site diversity statistics are summaries
    of the SFS.

Single-population demography

- Tajima's D and pi over time with size changes
- dynamics of allele frequency classes with size changes

********************
Multiple populations

- Comparison to some classical result in an IM model?
- m-T confounding in heatmap of Fst
- Fst with small sizes vs large divergence
- pi over time in OOA model
