description: The Gutenkunst et al. (2009) three-population model of human history. Time
  is given in years in the past. Choices to make, 1) which ends of the epochs should
  start and end times describe, 2) once that's decided, initial and final sizes should
  correspond to start and end time, resp. Currently, I'm looking backward in time, so
  start time is more recent and end time is the epoch interval end point farther in the
  past.
